## Variables in Dart
Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your program. In Dart, you can declare variables using var, final, or const.
✔ Use var when the value can change.
✔ Use final when the value won't change after being set.
✔ Use const when the value is fixed and known at compile time.

## Dart Data Types
Includes Number,Strings,Boolean,Lists,Maps,Runes,Null
### Lists
Dart List is similar to an array, which is the ordered collection of the objects. If you want to store multiple values without creating multiple variables, you can use a list.
Lists keep things in a specific order
