## Variables in Dart
Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your program. In Dart, you can declare variables using var, final, or const.
✔ Use var when the value can change.
✔ Use final when the value won't change after being set.
✔ Use const when the value is fixed and known at compile time.
