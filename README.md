# Dart
Dart is an open-source programming language  developed by the wizards at Google.  It’s used to create mobile 📱, web 🌐, and desktop 🖥 apps—and it’s awesome for server-side spells too! 
# Dart Features
🆓 Free and open-source! Yep, you can get started for $0.

🏎 Fast : It’s designed for speed—build Android, iOS, web, and desktop apps faster .

💻 Code once, run anywhere: Dart can compile into native code or JavaScript! Magic, right?

🚀 Null safety & async programming built right in! Write reliable, bug-free code while multitasking like a pro.

## Hello World
void main() {
  print('Hello, World! ');
}

## Variables in Dart
Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your program. In Dart, you can declare variables using var, final, or const.
✔ Use var when the value can change.
✔ Use final when the value won't change after being set.
✔ Use const when the value is fixed and known at compile time.

## Dart Data Types
Includes Number,Strings,Boolean,Lists,Maps,Runes,Null
### Lists
Dart List is similar to an array, which is the ordered collection of the objects. If you want to store multiple values without creating multiple variables, you can use a list.
Lists keep things in a specific order

### Maps
A map is a dynamic collection that represents a set of values ​as key-value pairs. Keys and values ​in the map can be of any type. Maps are like labeled boxes where each label (key) stores a specific value!

### Runes
A rune can be defined as an integer used to represent any Unicode code point. As a Dart string is a simple sequence of UTF-16 code units, 32-bit Unicode values in a string are represented using a special syntax.
Every symbol, letter, or emoji you use in Dart has a unique Unicode code point. For example:
The Unicode for the smiley face 😊 is U+1F60A.
The Unicode for the heart ❤️ is U+2764.
String.fromCharCodes() decodes the rune spell (Unicode values) into a readable string, turning the Unicode numbers into their corresponding symbols.

## 🌟 Control Flow in Dart
 Control flow allows you to decide which direction your code should take, whether to repeat an action, or jump to specific steps
 - Control flow statements in Dart can be divided into three exciting categories:

 ✔ Decision-Making Statements 🧠 (Make choices based on conditions) - If Statement, If-else Statements, Switch Case Statement

 ✔ Looping Statements 🔄 (Repeat code over and over) - for loop, For...in loop, while loop, do..while, 

 ✔ Jump Statements 🏃‍♂️ (Hop around different parts of the code)- return, assert, jump, continue
